Class 6: Lecture and problem set (Location: SCTR 12-146)
Our next class will be tomorrow in SCTR 12-146. We'll be learning how to write our own custom functions!
The lecture and problem set will both be a little shorter than usual, so this will be a good chance to catch up & ask questions about previous problem sets.
