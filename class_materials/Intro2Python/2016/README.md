# Class 1: Lecture and Problem set (Python Version: 2.7)
Programming Bootcamp 2016 will begin tomorrow at 9am sharp in SCTR 12-146! Remember to bring your laptop. Coffee and light snacks will be provided.
Below are the materials that we will go over tomorrow. You should be able to download them by right-clicking the links. I won't be providing printed copies.

Problem set
lab1_exercises.ipynb (read-only preview here)
 
The problem set is in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. We will go over how to use these in the lecture. For now, if you'd like to see a read-only (non-editable) preview of the problems, click the preview link above. This can be viewed even if you don't have Jupyter installed.
 
I've also prepared quick-reference guides to writing and running Python code, which you may find useful:
quick_ref_jupyter.pdf
quick_ref_script.pdf
 
Finally, please take a few minutes to complete the Python/Jupyter installation directions and terminal tutorial that was posted last week (@11) if you have not already.
 
See you tomorrow!
