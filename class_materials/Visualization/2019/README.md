# 2019 Data Vis Lecture

This directory contains the lecture materials, the notebook used to generate the plots used in the lecture, and the homework assignment.
All data used by these scripts is included in the directory `data`, but the paths in the notebooks assume the data is in the current directory to make things easier for the students.

Most of the data was generated specifically for this lecture, with the exception of `volcano_data.tsv`. 
`volcano_data.tsv` is under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license, and the original source can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2529117)
