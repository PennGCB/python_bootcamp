Then when you run the program, you will know if the responses are correct. Make sure to test all possibilities (higher, lower, equal, zero). Once you're sure the logic is correct, you can change the secret number to random generation.*"

    "Use a simulation to determine the average number of children in a family if all families had children until they had a girl (and then stopped). Assume equal probability of girls and boys and use a random generator to simulate each birth. Simulate 10,000 families and output the average number of children they had. Your answer should be close to 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note: I'm purposely not giving any step by step instructions here because I'd like you to practice translating a word problem into code. It may help if you try break down the problem into smaller parts first. For example, see if you can simulate just one family first, then once that's working, add code to make it run through 10,000 families. Alternatively, you might feel more comfortable writing code to print \"hi\" 10,000 times, and then replace \"print hi\" with code for simulating each family. Do whatever makes the problem feel more manageable to you. Learning to break down big problems into smaller parts like this is an essential skill for programming, so I encourage you to work through this. If you get it, then I think it's safe to say you've mastered the material in this lesson and are well on your way to becoming a true programmer!*\n",
