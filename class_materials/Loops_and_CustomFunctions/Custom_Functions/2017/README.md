SESSION 6: BRB 1001 !!!
Hello everyone! It is Sammy (again) and I am teaching Session 6 tomorrow (Sep. 21) at 10:30 in BRB 1001 on the 10th Floor. In this lecture we will be learning to write our own custom functions!

 

The lecture and problem set will both be a little shorter than usual, so this will be a good chance to catch up & ask questions about previous problem sets.

 

Attached is the lectures and exercises for session 6.
