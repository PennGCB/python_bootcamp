Here we have a few files that would be useful for students before
the class begins. Please pick and chose what you think would be the
most useful given the current years curriculum. You may want to 
edit/update them since they may have been written in 2016...

See the `editable` directory to find where you can edit the PDFs.

See the following 'README - setup guide.pdf' file for more info.
