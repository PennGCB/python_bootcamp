HOW TO RUN PYTHON BOOTCAMP


A few months out meet with TAs (first meeting)
* Clearly outline duties for each role

   (*Seems differences in expectations for each role lead to uneven distribution of work in past years*)
   1. Lecturer:
      * Create lecture material
      * Write homework
      * Monitor piazza and grade assignments/answer questions
      * Attend TA sessions
   2. TA:
      * Attend TA sessions
      * Monitor piazza and grade assignments/answer questions
      * Review material from lecture
   3. Admin/organizer:
      * Make surveys and disseminating responses/feedback
      * Upload lecture recordings
      * Set up bluejeans/reserving room
      * Recruit TAs
      * Make sure there are enough TAs per session, when things come up from TAs
      * Make sure TAs have needed material for the week
* Go over feedback from last year's participants
* Decide on Dates
   1. Date to end student registration
   2. Date to end TA registration
   3. Start Date of Course
   4. End Date of Course
* Decide what time you want to have the class (in 2019 we did Tuesdays from 2:30pm-4:30pm)
* Decide on how many classes you want per week
   1. As of 2018, we’ve done 1 class per week
      * Longer but more time to do homework
      * If students go away for a week, they don’t miss everything
      * Maybe students don’t remember the material from week to week as easy
   1. Before that, we did 2 classes per week
      * Shorter so less time intensive
      * Students remember material easier week to week
      * Not enough time for students to finish homework
      * Not enough time to grade students homework
* Decide on potential prizes and decide who will be in charge of getting them
* Decide who will be in charge of funding AND/OR getting food for course
   1. We got funding from both BGSA and IBI
   2. For BGSA we had to go to a meeting and ask for a merit request (see “BGSA_Funding_Python_Bootcamp” slides)
      * Here is the Merit Request Guide: https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgsa/merit-request-guide.html
      * We Used BGSA funding for FOOD
   1. For IBI, we asked Maureen if she could talk to Hannah
      * We Used IBI funding for drinks and prizes
* Decide the content of each class. In 2019, there was 8 lectures
   1. Intro to Python
   2. If-Else Statements
   3. Loops & Custom Functions
   4. Lists & Reading Files
   5. Dictionaries & Writing Files
   6. Custom Modules and Writing Scripts with argparse, sys, and os
   7. Pandas Crash Course
   8. Visualization
* Assign who will teach which lectures
   1. Alternating Lecturers in the past made it too confusing for students, and lack cohesion.
   2. I found that if a lecturer plans to teach lectures he/she must attend previous lectures so that he/she is familiar with what the students already know or do not know. 
* Can GCB endorse student's programming skills on Linked In after taking the course?
   1. Maureen says she can endorse as GCB coordinator on Linked In, but not via the GCB Linked In group. Would need to provide students her contact.
   2. Note: This will be in place of a certificate/credit, which we cannot do unfortunately


Right After Meeting but Before Class Starts
* Email maureen and ask her about:
   * IBI funding
   * Getting rooms for the dates you want
* For food, we usually use ABP. Once you know the date and have funding, you can call them (try 215-607-7239) and ask for an invoice. For IBI, send Hannah the invoice. For BGSA, you send bgsa.finance@gmail.com  the invoice and fill out a funding request form (https://www.med.upenn.edu/bgsa/funding-request-form.pdf) 
* Send out course announcements to both BGSA and Biology department (biology-all@bio.upenn.edu) about 2-3 weeks before course starts
   * Also specifically email Benjamin.Miron@tuhs.temple.edu (Ben Miron) he wrote to us 7/24/2019 asking if he could be notified if we do it again
   * In announcement include a date for when registration opens and advertise that. You can expect over 100 people to sign up. 
   * I created a poll so I could get to know who was registering...
* Post on slack to recruit TAs. Get creative. This can be difficult.
   * I had 3 types of TAs: Instructors, Advanced TAs, and Regular TAs
      * The instructors just went over the material for the lab
      * The advanced TAs volunteered to help grade homework.
      * The non-advanced TAs don’t grade homework. Both should be prepared for the class they volunteer for by reviewing the slides and the labs beforehand.
   * You may want to make a 4th type of TA that reviews and edits the labs and/or class activity. There is always room for improvement. Specifically, students wanted more “easy” questions in the later lectures.
   * REMEMBER to get each TA's email address so you can add them to Piazza later.
   * You also need to make sure you have enough TAs for each class. 

Before the first class
* Tell students if they are registered or not
* Set up Piazza (Use previous years as examples). 
* Make sure that students have jupyter installed (most important), access to a linux command line, and a text-editor (sublime). We have a lot of resources for students to do this on their own.
A week before every class
* Peer review slides and (class/homework) labs for the next week
   * Some of the code may be outdated
   * Some of the content may be outdated
* Post slides and (class/homework) labs for this week
   * Include extra files that are needed for the labs
* Remind TAs to review the lectures/labs before class


Before Every Class
* BRING A SIGN IN SHEET
* Go to the room an hour early to make sure that food arrived in the class room
* Make sure there are enough chairs around tables for people to use their computer


After Class
* Take a picture of the sign-in sheet and send it to bgsa.finance@gmail.com
* Clean up
* Grade the labs!
