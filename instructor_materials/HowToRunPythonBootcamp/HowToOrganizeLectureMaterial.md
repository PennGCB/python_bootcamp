HOW TO ORGANIZE LECTURE MATERIAL 

1. Devote lecture to helping students get setup
	* Installing python
	* Loading an environment and using it
		* Use pip instead of conda due to OS issues
	* Go over instructions for Homework
		* How to access homework 
		* How to fill in homework
		* How to submit homework
2. Make sure lecture directly covers what is needed for the homework, don’t assume students will be able to “google things” just yet
	* Example: If students need to use `count()` then make sure to cover this or at least have hints in the homework with a list of possible functions they can use
3. Create a cheat sheet of:
	* Common exceptions/messages/causes and how to address them
	* Glossary:
		* Term | One-sentence definition
3. Homework structure:
	* Notebooks vs editor?
		* If using notebooks might be easier for students to snippets of code
		* If using scripts make sure to clearly define inputs and outputs expected
	* Add test functions to HW scripts to help students learn faster and start to learn how to debug
	* Add follow-up, concept questions after each assignment to help students generalize the principles/skills intended to be learned and practiced in each assignment, beyond the specific context of the programming task. 
		* Example: "Which add_argument parameters would be useful to allow specification of indices from a table-like data file?”
4. Use python 3
5. CodeAcademy appeared to be very helpful for students
6. Suggest linters to encourage students to adopt conventions not formally enforced by the language.
	* Will need to make documentation to students for how to do this
