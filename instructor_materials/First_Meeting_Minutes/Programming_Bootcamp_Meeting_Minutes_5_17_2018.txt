Programming Bootcamp Meeting Minutes 05-17-18
Attendees: Raju, Scott, Will, Chris, Sammy, Binglan, Apexa
Key points discussed:
* Format of sessions (4 week, two classes a week 2 hours each) It was not enough time to complete assignments, if students go on vacation during summer they more likely to miss more than one class.
* When sessions are held (Fall vs Summer) Summer easier to get rooms and less responsibilities at the time for students and Tas
* Number of lectures
   * Alternating is too confusing for students, and lack cohesion.
   * Apexa, Scott, and Sammy expressed interest in instructing workshops.
   * Limiting it to two though :/ 
* There was a lot of demand for R workshops. Do we do a separate short (1 day) workshop?
   * Binglan is interested in helping with R
