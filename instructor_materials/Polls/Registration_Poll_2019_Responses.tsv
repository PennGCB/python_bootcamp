Though text and data mining have been around for many years, this technology has not yet been fully embraced by many libraries. My specific goal is to draft a Python script to handle complex reference queries--to refine search strategies and deduplicate search results at 100% accuracy in order to reduce the amount of search results that must be screened manually.  Though this may be an ambitious goal, I trust that I will develop the knowledge base needed to communicate effectively with IT and software vendors about our programming needs.	8
