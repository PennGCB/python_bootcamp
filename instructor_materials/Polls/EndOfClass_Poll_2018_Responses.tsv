How did you feel about having bootcamp once a week?	How did you feel about the structure of the class? (Eg. going over homework at the beginning of class, lecture, and working for the rest) Is there anything you would change?	Do you have any feedback for Apexa (Speaker 1)? What was good that she did? What could she improve on?	Do you have any feedback for Scott (Speaker 2)? What was good that he did? What could he improve on?	Do you have any feedback for the TAs? Could they have been more helpful? How?	Are there any topics you wish were covered?	Would you like to TA next time? If yes, please answer with your name and email.	How did you feel about homework feedback? Did you ever read the feedback?	On a scale of 0-5 how much has your python skills improved since taking this class	If you were on Yelp, how many stars would you give the class?	Is there anything else we should know?
Perfect		She was great!	He was great!	hard to determine who was a TA and who wasn't				4	4	
Perfect	Perfect!	Very good speaker and teacher!	I was not there during Scott’s presentations	The comments attached to the graded homework we’re clear and understandable	How big Python programs are structured and best practices in big projects	No	The feedback was great! Read them every time!	4	5	
Would rather have it twice a week	Liked the period of work time at the end; good for ensuring understanding and working with the TAs				Graphing and data visualization		Liked that homework feedback was given, and I did read it. However, I wouldn't blame you if you decided it made more sense for TAs to just go over common/important misconceptions at the start of lecture (as you already did) and save yourselves time on writing individual comments.	3	4	Meeting once a week was fine, but twice a week might make it less likely that I would forget things between sessions.
Perfect	Perfect. 	I think one of the things that Scott did was useful was actually typing in the code to illustrate and show outputs. It could help if Apexa tried this method. 	Scott was great and very knowledgeable. One thing he did that was a bit disconcerting was using functions in examples that we had not been over. It made the point, but I had to work through it and sometimes missed the next part. 	The TAs were awesome - they helped you work through stuff without giving the answer. How do you guys feel about the TAs helping grade homework. The one time Sammy graded my homework, I got excellent feedback on how to make my code better. 			Yes. Homework was great. 	2	4	The rating on the scale is more because I'm an idiot and less about how good the class was. I think given the time frame, the class was extremely helpful. Thanks a lot. 
Perfect	I'd hope the lecture can go more a bit in length. I feel like what was covered in the class is not enough for completing homework in ease. Still requires a whole bunch of googling. 	Great. Covered all the basics you need to know about Python.	Nice accent! 					3	4	
Perfect	it was good				pandas, matplotlib			4	5	
Perfect	Nope, it worked really well. 	Excellent! No room for improvement. 	Overall great. He could perhaps lighten up on the jargon/discussing topics that are not directly related to that week's content. I understand he often discussed those topics to answer questions that were bought up, but such tangents tended to lend themselves to confusion. I was perfectly satisfied when TA's were okay with saying "that is beyond the scope of this week's topic". However, he was generally very clear and helpful. 	Generally, everyone was very helpful and I liked the group a lot! One thing I would suggest is that I did not find it helpful when I would have a question and a TA would ask to take my computer and would then type the code out and then explain it. I found that I never actually understood what was going on when this happened. 	I thought it was well-organized! Perhaps training in R?	No	I did read the feedback and I really appreciate the time the TA's put into looking over the homework. It was extra motivation to complete it. 	3	4	Thanks for all the hard work! I have already started trying to use it for my research :)
Perfect	I think sometimes we spent too much time going over the homework, since I frequently did well enough that the lessons were redundant with what I'd already figured out. Maybe make an optional 30 minute or hour-long homework review session before the class? Or just let people know what time you plan to start the lecture? 						yes, it was helpful!	4	4	Great class! I'm very glad you added the Pandas module at the end.
Perfect	I thought the structure worked really well.  The homeworks were quite challenging which is a good thing but I did find them to be too time consuming to get through each week. 	I thought she was excellent and very clear.	Very good.	The TAs were extremely competent and helpful, and never made me feel stupid. :)	no	no	Good	3	5

Perfect	A little more emphasis on walking through homework assignments would have been nice. 							2	4
