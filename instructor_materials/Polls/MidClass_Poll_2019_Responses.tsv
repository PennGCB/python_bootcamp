How do you feel about having bootcamp once a week?	How did you feel about the structure of the class? (Eg. going over homework at the beginning of class, lecture, and working for the rest) Is there anything you would change?	How have you felt about the content of the labs (homework)?	Was there a specific lab you really liked? Why?	Was there a specific lab you thought was bad? Why?	If you did the labs, but you thought they were generally less than perfect, why did you feel that way? Was there anything general that we could fix?	How did you feel about the in-class assignments?	How do you feel about our homework feedback?	What do you specifically like/dislike about the feedback?	Do you have any feedback for Apexa (Speaker)? What was good that she did? What could she improve on?	Do you have any feedback for the TAs? 	On a scale of 0-5 how much has your python skills improved so far	How did you feel about the snacks?	Is there anything else we should know moving forward?
Would rather have it twice a week	No, I think it works well	Perfect	No particularly	No	N/A	I enjoyed them, but we don't need one for every class	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	N/A			5	Perfect	
Perfect	I have learned SO much from the class but I feel like I would learn better from a flipped classroom setting where we are given the lecture and some easy problems to 'solve' to get familiar with the code and then come to class for the activity. I would like to make use of the fact that TAs stick around for 2 hours post lectures but I have no idea what's happening at that time	Great, but always room for improvement	NA	NA	I can never finish everything - idk if that's actually important. I still feel like I come out with a decent understanding of the material	I feel like I don't have the tools to actually do them. would be much more productive if i did the homework first	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	i've seen attempts to comment on my code based on my line of thinking so it adds to the answers.			3	A non-caffeine/not hot drink option would be really great (since you run it in the summer)	
Would rather have it twice a week	Good	Great, but always room for improvement				Loved them! I wish we had them for every class.	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	Its specific, its constructive criticism, which is always a plus. Helps me improve.	Talks slowly and clearly, helps everyone understand.		4	More Food, Less Drinks	
Perfect	The current structure of the class works great for me.	Perfect			I like the way you start with guessing questions, basics of the concept learned, and the challenges for advanced skills. Great class!	I enjoyed them, but we don't need one for every class	Great! The feedback has been super helpful				3	Perfect	
Perfect	I like the examples covered in lecture, but don't find the actual lecture component that helpful, because it's basically just going over what's already on the slides. But the example problems are very helpful. 	They stressed me out.			I think Labs 1 and 2 were easy, but we needed more practice drills with them to make the material intuitive. Once we got to Lab 3, things started getting tough and I'm having a hard time getting through the material. 	I hate them. They stressed me out more than anything.	Great! The feedback has been super helpful				2	Perfect	
Perfect	I think that it is very appropriate; I like it! I also like the concept of having in-class activities, but it might help the students if the instructor continues to guide us through the exercise so that we can all complete it at the same time and acquire tools to answer the homework. :-) - a beginner's comment haha	Perfect	Loops are pretty cool, but honestly all the labs have been very interesting. 	I would not say bad, but fasta files are confusing. 	n/a	I enjoy them, but it might help if they were shorter so that we had enough time to discuss them at the end of class.	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	I definitely like all the positive reinforcement and the comments about how to improve my codes. Sometimes I figure out how to do stuff, although not in the most efficient way. I appreciate when the instructor tells me about alternative codes that work better. :) 	Thanks to Apexa for her hard work! I would say that some concepts are complex and difficult to digest (not her fault), so maybe spending a little bit more time explaining them might help beginners to understand them better. 	They are all great and I am very appreciative of their help! 	3	Perfect	
Perfect	I couldn't attend most of the lectures (the time wasn't the best for me) but I'm trying to follow the flow. 	Great, but always room for improvement			I kept mimicking what the problem sets told me, and I could do that task. But when confronting real question (or a few weeks later) I couldn't do it as well as I did in that problem set. I don't know how to improve this part though.	I'm indifferent.	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	Useful tips we didn't learn from the lecture. Cleaner codes. I learn that this complicated code I wrote could be written this simple by other people!			5	More Drinks, Less Food	I personally enjoy the class very much because it feels like playing with math. But I cannot say that I can do the coding now (even for the level I need to analyze my data). It's more of a playful math level.. but it's just halfway through, and it's getting more and more advanced, so I hope I can learn how to use programming to analyze my sequencing data!
Perfect	I think the in class problems were a little too challenging and I wish we had more time to go over how to do those as a class rather than have us struggle through them. 	They stressed me out.			I think that the labs were much more difficult than what we talked about in class and I think there was a lot that required knowledge outside of the class to answer. 	I hate them. They stressed me out more than anything.	Needs improvement	I wish that someone would provide me input on how I could have solved something more concisely. 	The speaker did a great job!	I like when the TAs would walk around and help us during the in class assignment. 	3	Perfect	
Perfect	Seems like a good approach	Perfect				I enjoyed them, but we don't need one for every class	Great! The feedback has been super helpful				4	Perfect	
Perfect	Good structure. Starting the homework in class makes it easier to engage with the homework and complete it.	Perfect				I liked them, but prefer to get started with the homework and have that as extra practice for downtime.	Great! The feedback has been super helpful	I like that alternatives on ways to solve the problem are offered.			4	Perfect
