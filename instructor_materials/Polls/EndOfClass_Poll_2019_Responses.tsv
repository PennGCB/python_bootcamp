No	5	3	1	3: It needs some improvements		I didn't attend nor do the homework			I didn't attend nor do the homework			2	Needed a lot more drills on the initial lessons to be able to keep up with beyond Week 4.	Have more confidence in your knowledge and ability. If you're not confident, it makes it hard for students to have confidence. 	1			
No	4	2	1	I didn't attend nor do the homework		I didn't attend nor do the homework			I didn't attend nor do the homework			3	I think that the content is really good! I put 3 because I felt that I needed more practice exercises. 		3			
No	8	7	0	3: It needs some improvements	It would be very helpful if we can get more problem examples in the lecture and go over syntax more. I googled and used forums, stack overflow, but it would be nice at this level to reinforce syntax in class.	3: It needs some improvements	I really liked the last lecture on graph construction. I wish we could have more lectures on how you guys analyze RNAseq or other bioinformatics problems other than primer design.		4: It was perfect			4	Like mentioned earlier, if we could have some more similar class examples that mimic the homework, that would be great.		5		Given the length of time, I understand if there is not enough time to cover more topics, I don't know how others would feel, but I personally could go for another months to learn more in-depth topics or have a lecture that kind of shows real-life examples/scripts of programs bioinformatitions use. I liked Apexa's primer design script explanation.	THANK YOU ALL!
No	8	7	0	4: It was perfect	I thought it was fine/good and the material in all of these classes is just difficult.	3: It needs some improvements	It was also very confusing but I don't know how they could do better.  Like I said, this is just hard and practice is the best way to understand this material. I think a more simplified slide(s) of how to initiate a dataframe would be good because I was lost from the start.	Overall Good and does not need improvement.	4: It was perfect		good	5	"Hard but good.

Maybe make it clear on the ""guess your answer"" part that you should explain your reasoning, which I did but which wasn't asked for and I found that helpful.

Also maybe encourage people to turn in incomplete homework, that might have encouraged the people who dropped out(?)"	They were all really good.	2	order was good	The structure is good as is and I would not change it. You would lose momentum if you did class every two weeks. If it was any more frequent, that would be impossible. I really like the in-class workshops and those need to stay.	"It would be nice if there were some forum discussions but that onus was on the students. (But if there were privately asked questions, then maybe make that not an option as I could have benefited from reading other people's questions/ answers.)

I feel like I personally could have benefited if I had a study buddy, but that onus was on me.

I really liked the lecture/slide that emphasized that programming is just hard and takes a lot of time, etc.  It is hard not to get discouraged or feel like I'm dumb or can't hack it in programming, especially it you are AFAB like me.

Snacks are nice, but maybe they could be done with less trash(?)"
No	7	2	4	4: It was perfect		3: It needs some improvements	There was too much content. I could follow the lecture, but some important information was missed.	She gives a lot of helpful information, but in general, the tangents make it difficult to follow what information is pertinent to the task at hand.	3: It needs some improvements	Since the lecture was so short, it might have been nice to do a simple in-class activity where we follow along instead of just presenting all of the plots.		2		Moving around more during the independent working section of the class might make asking you all questions easier. Also, standing/sitting in the front of the room instead of the back. 	2	I think the order was good	I wish the lectures had included more group-guided practice. 	Thanks!
No	8	7	0	2: It needs A LOT of improvement	It was helpful, but more clarity could be provided. More examples would be amazing.	2: It needs A LOT of improvement	Again, I think that this was rushed. More examples throughout, especially more complex examples would be helpful in completing the homework.	She was very prepared. She could slow down going through the lecture.	4: It was perfect	I think that this lecture was very good.	Ben was very good and prepared. If anything, he could try to be more engaging in the lecture.	4	Some of the homeworks were a little long, but they were very helpful in practicing the material!		4	I feel like the order worked well and made sense. Everything built upon itself which was great.	Overall, I think it was great! Having lectures once a week for 8 weeks was honestly ideal for my schedule. I feel like it might be harder to maintain attendance if it was twice a week.	
No	6	5	1	3: It needs some improvements	I think it would help if a bit more time was set aside during the previous lecture to help clarify getting the command line up and running. 	I didn't attend nor do the homework			I didn't attend nor do the homework			5		You guys were all very helpful and friendly and definitely did a good job helping out with exercises. In general, I'd say the lectures were good but most of them spent a bit too much time going over extremely basic examples of the concepts covered before sending us off to do fairly tricky in class exercises/homeworks. I think it could be beneficial to close the gap a little bit there, meaning to include some more intermediate/difficult example exercises in the lectures that we go over as a class. 	4	I think the order and pacing made sense. 	I think it's about the ideal set up for a "boot camp" style class as is. 	Thanks!!
